## Summary

Cloud computing provides research institutions the benefits of flexible and scalable computing and storage resources. However, the pay-for-what-you-use pricing model poses a challenge to organisations that need some certainty in outgoings.

In response, we have developed [RCTab](https://rctab.readthedocs.io/) (**R**esearch **C**omputing **Tab**les), an open-source system for automating the management of [subscriptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/organize-resources#management-levels-and-hierarchy) on Azure, Microsoftâ€™s cloud computing platform. It saves time spent monitoring costs and allows researchers to have greater control over their cloud resources without the risk of excessive spending.

It is written in Python and has Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployment that can be used to quickly and repeatably deploy it to Azure.

## Statement of Need

Institutions are increasingly adopting cloud platforms for both operational and research computing infrastructure, with many adopting hybrid or cloud-first approaches. The benefits include easy and flexible access to cutting edge hardware without substantial upfront investment.

Compared to traditional infrastructure with dedicated servers (e.g. on-premises/HPC systems), this presents a new challenge in controlling costs, particularly for the latest hardware such as the GPUs. Therefore, it is important to have robust cost management mechanisms.

A simple method to manage costs on Azure would be to have one Azure subscription per research project. Azure provides tools to monitor costs for a subscription, to forecast costs and to send alerts when a budget threshold has been reached.

We identified an opportunity to extend Azure's in-built cost management functionality to make it more useful to researchers and research institutions by developing a system to turn off a subscription, which stops all spending, when a budget has been exceeded. In addition, we realised that adding an expiry date to subscriptions would be useful to the research community as grant funding is often time-limited.

## Source Code

The source code for RCTab is contained in five repositories:

- the [CLI](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/rctab-cli) repo contains a Pip-installable Python package.
- the [Infrastructure](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/rctab-infrastructure) repo contains code for automated deployment with Pulumi.
- the [API](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/rctab-api) repo has code for the webserver, which is pushed [to DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/turingrc/rctab-api) each time there is a new release.
- the Functions repo contains three Azure function apps, which are also pushed to DockerHub ([usage](https://hub.docker.com/r/turingrc/rctab-usage), [status](https://hub.docker.com/r/turingrc/rctab-status) and [controller](https://hub.docker.com/r/turingrc/rctab-controller)) each release.
- the [eponymous repo](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/rctab) houses the general documentation (the other repos also have sites for component-specific documentation).

Detailed instructions on how to deploy RCTab to Azure with Pulumi can be found in the docs for the Infrastructure repository.

## Operation

Once deployed to Azure, an instance of RCTab will comprise:

- A FastAPI web server, which uses the API Docker image. This allows users to view budgets, RBAC assignments and the state of subscriptions.
- Three function apps, running their respective Docker images, that collect data and enable/disable subscriptions.
- A PostgreSQL database.
- Logging and alerts.

Users can use the web frontend to see their subscriptions' spending while administrators can use the CLI to create and edit budgets. RCTab integrates with Microsoft Entra ID (previously "Azure Active Directory") to provide "Single Sign On" authentication for both users and administrators.

The Usage and Status functions run on an schedule to collect information about subscriptions and post it to the web server.

The Controller function will check hourly to see whether any subscriptions need to be turned off or on.

The web server will email users about changes to their subscriptions.

## Lifecycle of a Subscription

As mentioned previously, a simple method for organising an Azure tenant is to create one subscription per project (or per-group or per-department, etc). Role-based Access Control (RBAC) can be used to grant permissions to researchers at the subscription level, allowing them to create, modify and delete resource groups and resources within that subscription.

Once a subscription has been created, it will need to be placed into a management group so that RCTab can monitor it. RCTab will have been given control over a management group during setup.

Using the CLI, an administrator must add an "approval" for the subscription to RCTab that specifies the amount and duration of the budget for the subscription.

When the subscription approaches its budget or expiration date, RCTab will send an email to users with role assignments to give them a chance to request a budget increase or an extension.

If this is granted, the admin can extend the approval with the CLI.

If the request is denied, the subscription will eventually be disabled by RCTab and, again, users will be notified by email. Azure will permanently delete the subscription after approximately 90 days, though the subscription can be re-activated up until the point that they are deleted.
